# Vue.js Fundamentals

Learn the basics of Vue.js, the progressive framework. Learn how reactivity works within Vue.js and how we can use it to start building frontend applications with this library.

## Dependencies

### Vue CLI
To install the new package, use one of the following commands. You need administrator privileges to execute these unless npm was installed on your system through a Node.js version manager (e.g. n or nvm).
```
    npm install -g @vue/cli
    # OR
    yarn global add @vue/cli
```

### Instant Prototyping
You can rapidly prototype with just a single `*.vue` file with the `vue serve` and `vue build` commands, but they require a global addon to be installed along with the Vue CLI:
```
    npm install -g @vue/cli-service-global
    # or
    yarn global add @vue/cli-service-global
```
